  <p>I'm a hard-working, high school junior, learning web development on my way to becoming a data scientist. I've
    always picked up algorithmic learning quickly and it is what I enjoy most (apologies to my history and English
    teachers if you are reading this).</p>
  <p>I successfully built up a dog boarding business that was an incredibly fun and educational experience. It was also
    very lucrative, as I have now saved enough to pay for my first year of college!</p>
  <p>I'm currently enrolled in this Web Development class as well as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Statistics, and
    Honors Precalculus. This summer, I am planning to take my first actual college class - Calculus.</p>
